# CarSalesAnalysis
Dataset was given by IBM Accelerator Catalog

Using Excel I was able to use cleaned data given to me to create pivot tables, graphs, and a visual dashboard to display findings. 

Graphs of the pivot tables included werequanity sold by dealer ID, profit by date and model, profit by year and dealer ID, and sum of profits for Hudson model cars by dealer ID.
